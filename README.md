## ✨ Animations

- Centralized Framer Motion variants in `src/lib/animations.ts`  
- `useScrollAnimation` hook uses Intersection Observer for performant triggers  
- GPU‑friendly transforms and custom easing `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]`  

## 🚢 Deployment

- Deployed on Netlify; publish the `dist/` directory after `npm run build`.  
- Reference images via absolute paths from `public/` (e.g., `/images/...`).  

## ⚙️ Configuration Notes

- Path alias `@/` maps to `src/`  
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`  
- Intersection Observer thresholds tuned for smooth entry and one‑time triggers
